// Single A/V compositor for the publisher.
//
// It composites optional camera + screen video onto a FIXED-size <canvas> and mixes
// optional mic + system audio through a WebAudio graph. It exposes ONE stable video
// track (the canvas) and ONE stable audio track (the mix destination) for the whole
// session. Toggling camera/screen/mic changes only the *inputs* — the published track
// identities never change, so viewers never get a RESET_STREAM (and the <moq-watch>
// element, which can't re-subscribe after a track reset, never freezes) when sources
// are added or removed mid-broadcast.
//
// Why a FIXED canvas size: changing a captureStream track's resolution mid-stream forces
// the MoQ video encoder to reconfigure, which republishes the catalog and resets the
// track — exactly the freeze we're avoiding. A constant 1280x720 canvas keeps the encoder
// (and the viewer's subscription) stable; camera/screen content is letterboxed to fit.
//
// DO NOT "fix" portrait capture by resizing this canvas on rotation. Earthseed solves the
// same problem the opposite way — it sizes the encoder to the camera's displayed dimensions
// and reconfigures on portrait<->landscape (earthseed 7503a51) — because it owns its encoder
// and renderer. We publish through <moq-watch>, which cannot re-subscribe after a track
// reset, so adopting that here would trade a cosmetic crop for every viewer freezing each
// time the broadcaster turns their phone.
//
// The orientation half of that fix IS already present here, arrived at independently:
// compositing via ctx.drawImage(video, …) renders the frame as DISPLAYED on every browser,
// including iOS Safari where `new VideoFrame(videoElement)` hands back un-rotated sensor
// pixels. Sizing from videoWidth/videoHeight (post-rotation) rather than getSettings() is
// the other half. So phone capture is upright; only the framing differs.
//
// KNOWN COST, accepted deliberately: drawCover crops a portrait source hard. A 720x1280
// phone scales to 1280x2276 and only the middle ~32% of its vertical field of view survives.
// drawContain would keep the whole frame at the price of pillarbox bars baked into the
// stream. Crop was chosen over bars; revisit that as a product decision, not as a bug fix,
// and note that neither option requires touching the fixed canvas size.
//
// Why a WebAudio mix: swapping the published audio track when crossing camera→screen
// (mic → system audio) would reset the audio track the same way. Instead the mix's output
// track is constant and we connect/disconnect mic and system-audio inputs behind it.
