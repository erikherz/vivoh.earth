// Relay-blind end-to-end media encryption (AES-GCM per encoded chunk).
//
// GOAL: the CDN relay (tinymoq) forwards only ciphertext it cannot read. The
// access JWT gates the *connection*; this content key gates *decryption*. They
// layer — even the relay operator, or an unauthorized connection, sees only
// opaque bytes. This is NOT DRM: an authorized viewer can still capture decoded
// frames. See PER-BROADCAST-TOKENS.md / stream-security.md §7 for scope.
//
// HOW IT HOOKS IN (no public @moq API exists, so we patch the library at build
// time — see vite.config.ts `mediaCryptoPatch`, same mechanism as the existing
// `moqWebTransportOnly` patch). The legacy container frame on the wire is:
//     [varint timestamp][raw codec payload]
// We keep the varint in the clear (the container reads it, and we bind it as
// AES-GCM additional-authenticated-data) and encrypt only the payload:
//     [varint timestamp][12-byte nonce][AES-GCM ciphertext + 16-byte tag]
// MoQ object/group framing is untouched, so the relay still routes groups and
// keyframe boundaries exactly as before. The catalog (codec config / SPS-PPS)
// travels via writeJson, NOT through these seams, so it stays in the clear by
// design (decision: leak codec/resolution metadata, never content).
//
// The patched library code reaches us through a page-scoped global
// (`globalThis.__VIVOH_MEDIA_CRYPTO__`) that we install when a key is
// provisioned. The global is never exposed to the relay (the relay never runs
// our JS). When no key is armed, the global is absent and the library behaves
// byte-for-byte as upstream (passthrough).
//
// NONCE: a fresh 12-byte random nonce per chunk, carried in the frame. The
// publisher is the sole encryptor (the relay fans out identical ciphertext to
// every viewer — that is what preserves MoQ single-encode fan-out), so nonce
// uniqueness is a single-writer problem; random 96-bit nonces are safe well
// past our per-session frame counts and need no cross-track / cross-reconnect
// coordination (the failure mode of counters). The GCM auth tag additionally
// gives integrity for free: a tampering/injecting relay fails decryption.

// drops the frame it cannot decrypt and hands the FOLLOWING delta frames to the decoder. A

 * because it is an input to KEY DERIVATION, no server can grant access without it — not a
 * compromised Worker, not a subpoena, not the operator.
 *
 * Vivoh.Earth replaces that with `require_auth`: the broadcaster ticks a box and the Worker
 * refuses to mint a viewer token to anyone without a session. That is a real access control
 * and it is the right one for a known audience, but be exact about what changed:
 *
 *   access control moved OUT of cryptography and INTO server policy.
 *
 * The operator can now grant and revoke viewing. Under the passcode model they could do
 * neither. What did NOT change: the content key is still derived here, in the browser, from
 * the link fragment that browsers never transmit — so the relay and the Worker still cannot
 * decrypt anything. Relay-blind survives; the second factor does not.
 *
 * Do not reintroduce a passcode field here without also restoring the UI and the viewer
 * prompt — a half-wired one would silently derive a key nobody else can match.
