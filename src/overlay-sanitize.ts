// The broadcaster's overlay markup, made safe to put in a viewer's document.
//
// One module, used twice: the viewer renders through it, and the broadcaster's editor previews
// through the SAME call. That is deliberate — an allowlist the author cannot see the effect of
// is indistinguishable from a bug, which is exactly how the first version of this was
// experienced: headings and lists came out as unstyled text with no explanation.
//
// WHAT THIS IS DEFENDING
//
// Not the page. The content key. The viewer's document derives a media key from the share link
// and holds it in memory, so ANY script running in that document can read it and hand the
// plaintext to someone the broadcaster never shared it with. Every rule below exists to keep
// attacker-controlled script out of this origin; nothing else here is load-bearing.
//
// `<script>` was never the interesting payload — innerHTML does not execute script tags. The
// real vector is event-handler attributes, which it does honour, so `<img src=x onerror=…>`
// runs. That is why this uses a real sanitiser and not tag filtering.
//
// WHAT IS ALLOWED, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE
//
// Structure and text — headings, lists, tables, rules, quotes, media — carry no scripting
// capability at all. Their absence from the first allowlist bought nothing; a page cannot be
// attacked with an `<h1>`. They are all back.
//
// IFRAMES, WHICH ARE THE ONE REAL TRADE
//
// An embed is a third party's page inside ours, and the rule that makes it survivable is
// simple: it must not be OUR origin. A cross-origin frame cannot touch `window.parent` — the
// same-origin policy stops it — so pollev.com, YouTube or a map can run all the script they
// like and never reach the key. Two shapes break that and are refused:
//
//   - a same-host src (`/`, `https://wallflower.tv/…`), which IS this origin and can walk
//     straight up to the parent document;
//   - `srcdoc`, which inherits the embedding origin and is the same hole wearing a hat.
//
// Anything non-https is refused too, so an embed cannot downgrade the page.
//
// Three attributes are then forced rather than trusted, because each is a way for the frame to
// climb back out:
//
//   - `sandbox` — set by us, and notably WITHOUT allow-top-navigation, so an embed cannot
//     navigate the viewer away from the broadcast they are watching. allow-same-origin is
//     present and is safe precisely because we forced the src cross-origin: it gives the frame
//     its OWN origin (pollev.com), not ours, which is what its cookies and storage need.
//   - `allow` — permissions delegation. Left alone, an embed could ask for `camera; microphone;
//     geolocation` and be handed the viewer's devices by a page they trusted for a broadcast.
//     Overwritten with a media-only set.
//   - `referrerpolicy` — the share link lives in the URL. Not sending it to a third party.
//
// The remaining hole in that story is a frame navigating ITSELF to this origin after load,
// which allow-same-origin would then make same-origin. The Worker closes it from the other
// side by serving `frame-ancestors 'none'`, so no wallflower.tv document can be framed at all.
// Both halves are required; do not remove one because the other looks sufficient.
