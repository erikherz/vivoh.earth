// Going live WITHOUT a publish key shows the camera. Does it also SEND it?
//
// The preview is local by construction — a <video> pointed at the capture MediaStream — so
// seeing yourself proves nothing either way, which is exactly why it deserves checking rather
// than reasoning about. If admission failed but publishing started anyway, a broadcaster who
// closed the prompt would be transmitting while believing they had not begun.
//
// Verified from four independent angles, because any one of them could pass for a bad reason:
//   1. no WebTransport session is opened at all
//   2. the <moq-publish> element is never given a url
//   3. no go-live request reaches the Worker
//   4. no broadcast row appears in D1 for this session
//
//   node scripts/e2e/no-key-no-publish.mjs [origin]
//
// Deliberately takes NO publish key: it runs in a fresh context with empty localStorage.
