// WebSocket, connect() then only ever attempts WebTransport — no fallback, no race.

// Relay-blind end-to-end media encryption: patch the @moq media-frame seams.
//
// There is no public hook in @moq/publish or @moq/watch to touch the encoded
// chunk bytes, so — exactly like moqWebTransportOnly above — we patch the
// dependency at build time. Three seams, all in readable (non-minified) source:
//
//   1. ENCRYPT video — @moq/hang/container/legacy.js `Producer.encode`
//      (video publishes through Legacy.Producer → group.writeFrame).
//   2. ENCRYPT audio — @moq/net/.../track.js `Track.writeFrame`
//      (audio publishes one group per frame via Track.writeFrame).
//   3. DECRYPT both  — @moq/hang/container/consumer.js, before Format.decode
//      (the single media read site for both audio and video).
//
// Each seam routes through globalThis.__VIVOH_MEDIA_CRYPTO__ (installed by
// src/crypto/media-crypto.ts only when a key is armed). With nothing armed the
// global is absent and every seam is byte-for-byte upstream behavior. The
// catalog uses writeJson (a different path) so codec config stays in the clear.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED: buildEnd throws if any seam did not patch — we never ship a
// build that could leave a media payload path unencrypted while the feature is
// believed active. (A future @moq upgrade that changes these strings will fail
// the build loudly rather than silently publish plaintext.)
// The @moq versions these seams were read against and re-derived for. A string match proves
// only that a string matched — @moq/net's writeFrame body was byte-identical across 0.1.5 and
// 0.3.5 while its argument changed from bytes to an object, so the audio seam patched happily
// into a shape it no longer understood. Pinning the versions turns that class of silent drift
// into a build failure with an instruction attached.
//
// Bumping a version here is a deliberate act: re-read all three seams in the new sources first,
// then change these, then run scripts/e2e/encrypted-negative.mjs against a deploy.

  // object. The other two seams broke loudly and were fixed; this one would have shipped,
  // handing the encryptor an object it cannot encrypt.

  // The lesson is that "the string was replaced" is not the same claim as "the path is

  // version assertion in buildEnd below, and requireFrame() in media-crypto.ts, which throws
  // on the first frame if the shape is not what these seams assume.

  // Also where AUDIO GROUP BATCHING lives, because this is the one place a frame becomes a
  // group and a group becomes a QUIC stream.
  //
  // Upstream opens a group per audio frame, so 20ms Opus = ~50 unidirectional streams/sec.
  // iOS Safari stops delivering after ~7600 cumulative streams on a session (measured across
  // four runs at two rates), which is ~2.5 minutes of audio. Batching N frames into one group
  // divides the stream rate by N.
  //
  // It costs no latency. A group is a live open stream, not a buffer: the publisher writes
  // each frame the instant it is encoded (lite/publisher.js #runGroup loops on readFrame) and
  // the consumer decodes each as it arrives. Frame duration, catalog jitter and the client's
  // AV-sync target are all untouched. What it costs is loss independence — the N frames share
  // a stream, so a lost packet delays the rest of that group by about one RTT instead of
  // damaging a single 20ms frame.
  //
  // Batching is a PUBLISHER decision and reaches every viewer: one set of groups goes to the
  // relay and there is no per-subscriber regrouping. It cannot be limited to mobile viewers.
  //
  // Gated on the audio track by name — writeFrame is generic and nothing else should batch.
  // globalThis.__VIVOH_AUDIO_GROUP__ <= 1 restores upstream behaviour byte for byte.
  // AND where AUDIO-OVER-DATAGRAMS lives, for the same reason: this is the one place a frame
  // becomes a group and a group becomes a QUIC stream, so it is the one place to stop doing
  // that. Upstream has no datagram media path at all — @moq/net carries appendDatagram and
  // recvDatagram, but @moq/hang, @moq/publish and @moq/watch contain zero references to
  // datagrams between them, so both ends of this are ours to write.
  //
  // WHY: iOS Safari stops delivering after ~7000 cumulative incoming unidirectional streams,
  // and 20ms Opus burns that in ~135 seconds. QUIC datagrams (RFC 9221) consume no stream ids
  // and are exempt from connection-level flow control, so they sidestep both candidate
  // mechanisms. Audio is ~99% of our streams; video is ~0.5/s and is NOT moved (a 720p frame
  // does not fit the ~1200 byte limit, and a lost video frame corrupts until the next keyframe
  // where a lost audio frame is a concealable 20ms gap).
  //
  // BEST-EFFORT, WITH NO FALLBACK. A datagram that does not fit, or that the transport cannot
  // carry, is simply not delivered — the relay has no group fallback either (moq-lite.md: "There
  // is no stream fallback"). So this is gated OFF by default and opt-in per broadcast via
  // ?adg=1, because a publisher on the WebSocket transport (Firefox is forced onto it, and this
  // deployment deliberately keeps that fallback) reports maxDatagramSize 0 and would publish
  // audio into a void, silently.

  // --- seam 4: RECEIVE audio datagrams (consumer.js #run) ---

  // The other half of audio-over-datagrams. @moq/net's Track.Subscriber has recvDatagram(), but
  // nothing in @moq/hang or @moq/watch ever calls it, so a datagram published by seam 2 would
  // arrive at the relay, cross it, reach the browser, and be dropped on the floor.
  //
  // WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. A datagram is definitionally "a single-frame group": lite-05 gives
  // it the same sequence namespace as groups, and the payload is exactly what one frame of a
  // one-frame group would carry. So rather than synthesise entries into #groups and re-implement
  // this file's reset / rewind / latency-skip / PTS-contiguity machinery (and get some of it
  // subtly wrong, which shows up as stutter rather than as an error), we adapt the datagram into
  // the shape #run already consumes and change exactly one line: where a group comes from.
  //
  // Everything downstream is then untouched and free: ordering by sequence, the stale/reset
  // classification, the latency budget — and seam 3, which sits inside #runGroup and therefore
  // DECRYPTS datagram payloads with no extra code. That is the main reason to adapt rather than
  // duplicate: the encryption path stays single.
  //
  // The two pending promises are held across iterations on purpose. A naive
  // `Promise.race([recvGroup(), recvDatagram()])` per loop would discard the loser's pending
  // read every time, silently dropping whichever arrived second.
  //
  // Always on, and safe to be: on a publisher that sends no datagrams the datagram promise
  // simply never settles, and on a transport without them recvDatagram is absent or throws,
  // which the guard treats as "groups only" for the life of the subscription.
